<p>MST JUNIOR SCHOOL
 This school is agricultural school with different activities done plus normal lessons as every school.
We have additional lessons like ict agricultre and home economics.We as MST try so much to raise a student who is well all round in different areas.
MST is so good that with the growing technology, our students are able to fit in the environment. we try to create an environment of what is in the real world.
We make sure that our students interact with different people  to get experience all round.
With the chat l have had with the kids in the school, i conclude saying that parents should try the  school. </p>
